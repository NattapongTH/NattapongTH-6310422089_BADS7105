# <p align="center"> Customer Journey </p>
***

# Defination:
The customer journey in marketing refers to the customer’s path, via touchpoints, to their decision to purchase an item. 
A customer doesn’t usually decide to purchase an item immediately after finding out about it for the first time. 
Usually, customers look at a product or a brand several times before deciding on an action, known in marketing as touchpoints. 
The customer journey then proceeds through these touchpoints.
