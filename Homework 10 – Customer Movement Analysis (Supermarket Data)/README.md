# Concept:
- Customer churn (or customer attrition) is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a companyâ€™s products or services during a particular time period is called a customer churn (attrition) rate.

- Use google bigquery to calculate churn monitoring by seperate 5 groups
	- REPEAT = Customer who purchase in last month + purchase in current month
	- REACTIVATED = Customer who purchase in last 2 month + not purchase in last month + back to purchase again in current month  
	- New = Customer who start purchase in current month
	- CHURN = Customer who purchase in last month + not purchase in current month
	- GONE = Customer who not purchase in 2 month or more
