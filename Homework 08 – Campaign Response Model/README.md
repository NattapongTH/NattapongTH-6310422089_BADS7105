# Concept:
- Product recommendation is basically a filtering system that seeks to predict and show the items that a user would like to purchase. It may not be entirely accurate, but if it shows you what you like then it is doing its job right.

- After classroom survey (purchasing history of many item as 1. used to buy ("เคยซื้อ") and 2. never buy it ("ไม่เคยซื้อ")), the raw data is cleaned by replace NULL with never buy it. check data profiling, etc.

- Then, criteria of basket analysis consist of
	1. 'Lift' > 1.01 --> Result =  416,718 row
	2. Limit item only 1 in 'Antecedents' and 'Consequents', Set 'Support' > 0.55 and set 'Confidence' > 0.91 --> Result = 29 row (my target is lower than 30)
