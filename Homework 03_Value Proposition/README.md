# <p align="center"> Value Proposition Canvas</p>
Note
- To show concept of analysis for beginning level (excel base)
- Data sample from student in class only
***

# Concept:
- Find insight from student's diary by use Canvas tool
- Focus only "Dinner"

# What is Value Proposition Canvas?:
- A tool which can help ensure that a product or service is positioned around what the customer values and needs.

# Source:
- Survey 1 day activity of each student

# Data preparation:
- Combine dairy of each student to one file
- Change time format to only one pattern

- Use function "FIND" to find eating activity. Then create tempo column to some result from column "G" to "J" that we will get all eating activity.

- Use function "MAX(IF" to find dinner from eating activity. Use this line to find gains and pains to analysis canvas
